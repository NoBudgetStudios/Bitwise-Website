        <h2>Set Up:</h2>
        <p id="setup-description">
			<div>
			Every player takes a Tutorial Card face up in front of them. 
			Shuffle the White 4Bit Cards deck and place it face down on the upper left corner of the 5x5 Bit Grid. 
			Draw 8 cards and place them face up completing the first row and the first column of the grid. 
			Then find the corresponding 4Bit Cards from the Black 4Bit Deck and form a face down pile with them 
			(Black 4Bit Deck will not be used again in the setup). Then shuffle the face down pile and deal to each Player:
			</div>
			
			<div>2 Players, 4 Black 4Bit Cards</div>
			<div>3 Players, 3 Black 4Bit Cards</div>
			<div>4 Player, 2 Black 4Bit Cards</div>


			Then, shuffle Bit cards, Gate cards and Special Cards forming the Deck. Deal 8 cards to each player clockwise from the Deck. The player who looked at any kind of screen most recently, starts first.

        <h2>In a Turn:</h2>
        <p id="inATurn-description">
			A player, in their turn, first draws a card from the Bit Deck. 
			Then they can play up to 1 card of each Type (Bit, Special, Gate) in any order, 
			unless a played card states otherwise. If a player does not play any card, 
			they draw a card from the Special Deck. Eitherway, right after that, they pass 
			their turn to the next player on the left (clockwise).
