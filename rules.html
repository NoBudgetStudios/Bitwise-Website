		<p id="howToWin-description">
			To win a Bitwise game, a player must complete the 4Bit sequences, indicated by one of their Black 4Bit Cards, to score a Bit Point and turn the corresponding White 4Bit Card face down. A player wins based on the following criteria:
            <table>
            <tr>
                <td>2 Players</td>
                <td>Score 4 Bit Points</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3 Players</td>
                <td>Score 3 Bit Points</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4 Players</td>
                <td>Score 2 Bit Points</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

    <section id="setup">
        <h2>Set Up:</h2>
        <p id="setup-description">
            To set up the game, follow these steps:
            <ol>
                <li>Every player takes a Tutorial Card face up in front of them.</li>
                <li>Shuffle the White 4Bit Cards deck and place it face down on the upper left corner of the 5x5 Bit Grid.</li>
                <li>Draw 8 cards and place them face up to complete the first row and the first column of the grid.</li>
                <li>Find the corresponding 4Bit Cards from the Black 4Bit Deck and form a face-down pile with them (the Black 4Bit Deck will not be used again in the setup).</li>
                <li>Shuffle the face-down pile and deal to each player:</li>
				<table>
				<tr>
					<td>2 Players</td>
					<td>4 Black 4Bit Cards</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>3 Players</td>
					<td>3 Black 4Bit Cards</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>4 Players</td>
					<td>4 Black 4Bit Cards</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
                <li>Then, shuffle Bit cards, Gate cards, and Special Cards to form the Deck.</li>
                <li>Deal 8 cards to each player clockwise from the Deck.</li>
                <li>The player who looked at any kind of screen most recently starts first.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>In a Turn:</h2>
        <p id="inATurn-description">
            During their turn, a player should:
            <ol>
                <li>Draw a card from the Deck.</li>
                <li>Play up to 1 card of each Type (Bit, Special, Gate) in any order unless a played card states otherwise.</li>
                <li>If a player does not play any cards, they must draw another card from the Deck.</li>
                <li>Afterward, pass their turn to the next player on the left (clockwise).</li>
