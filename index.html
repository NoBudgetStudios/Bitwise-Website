        <p id="story-description">
			In the age of 20, I was a quite creative Informatics student, always driven by a deep love for both technology and games.

The concept simmered and evolved as I honed my skills and embraced the creative process.

        <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
        <p id="gameplay-description">
			Let's dive into the heart of 'Bitwise,' where the gameplay is as engaging as it is straightforward. At its core, 'Bitwise' is a competitive card game designed for players who appreciate the perfect blend of strategy and technology.
		
			The goal is simple: complete rows or columns on a grid with Bit Cards, each representing a 0 or 1. These sequences of 4 bits are the key to earning points, but they're not the only trick up your sleeve.
			
			You'll strategically draw and play Bit Cards, aiming to match specific target numbers each round. It's a delicate balance of constructing sequences, outsmarting your rivals, and perhaps even a dash of luck.
			
			But that's not all. Special Cards add an extra layer of intrigue. They can grant you strategic advantages or disrupt your opponents' plans. Timing is everything when it comes to playing these game-changing cards.
			
			The player with the most points at the end of each round emerges victorious. So, whether you're a seasoned gamer or just love a good challenge, 'Bitwise' promises an exhilarating experience that's easy to learn and impossible to put down.
			
			Join us on this Kickstarter adventure, and let's celebrate our shared love for technology and strategy. Together, we'll make 'Bitwise' a reality and introduce the world to a game that's as dynamic as it is fun.
