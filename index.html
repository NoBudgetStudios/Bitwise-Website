        <h2>What is Bitwise:</h2>
        <p id="intro-description">
            <p>Bitwise is a card game where players complete rows or columns on a grid with Bit Cards (0s and 1s) 
			to form 4-bit sequences matching their target numbers for points.</p>
			<p>Players draw and play Bit Cards 
			strategically while Special Cards introduce unique actions. Balancing targets and disrupting opponents 
			creates a dynamic and competitive experience.</p>
			<p>The player with the most points wins each round, earned by completing targets and using strategic 
			Bit and Special Cards.</p>
			<p>Bitwise is designed for 2 to 4 players, 
			accessible to all from casual gamers to seasoned strategists combining binary precision with card-based 
			strategy for an engaging experience.</p>
