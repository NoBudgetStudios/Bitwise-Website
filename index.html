        <h2>Story:</h2>
        <p id="story-description">
            <p>Back in my 20s, I was a creative Informatics student with a deep passion for technology and games. That's when the idea for Bitwise first sprouted. Bitwise is more than just a card game; it's the result of years of nurturing my love for technology and gaming. It's a game that seamlessly merges the world of 0s and 1s with the strategic challenges of card games.</p>
			<p>This campaign isn't just about launching a game; it's an invitation for you to join a journey that's been years in the making. Bitwise is a testament to my dedication, evolving from my early university attempts to the polished experience it is today. Bitwise isn't just about playing cards; it's about choices, strategy, the thrill of outsmarting opponents, and a sprinkle of luck. It's about completing sequences, executing tactical maneuvers with Special Cards, and relishing victory. As we embark on this Kickstarter adventure, we're aware of the challenges ahead. But we're committed to bringing Bitwise to your gaming table with your support.</p>
			<p>Join us in this adventure, pledge your support, unlock special rewards, and become part of the Bitwise community. Let's celebrate our shared love for technology and gaming, and let Bitwise be the bridge that connects our passions. Thank you for considering Bitwise and being a part of this journey that began in a university classroom and has now found its way to your heart.</p>

        <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
        <p id="gameplay-description">
			<p>Bitwise is an exciting card game where players complete rows or columns on a grid with Bit Cards (0s and 1s) to form 4-bit sequences matching target numbers for points. Players draw and play Bit Cards strategically while Special Cards introduce unique actions. Balancing targets and disrupting opponents creates a dynamic and competitive experience.</p>
			<p>The player with the most points wins each round, earned by completing targets and using strategic Bit and Special Cards. Bitwise is designed for 2 to 4 players, accessible to all from casual gamers to seasoned strategists. It combines binary precision with card-based strategy for an engaging experience.</p>
